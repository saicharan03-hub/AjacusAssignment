# 🧑‍💼 Employee Directory Web Application

A responsive and interactive web interface to manage and browse employee details, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**. This app simulates basic CRUD operations (add, delete) with filtering, sorting, searching, pagination, and modal form features — all without a backend.

## 🚀 Setup & Run Instructions

### 📁 Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- No backend required — runs entirely in your browser

### ▶️ Running the App
1. Download or clone the project folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-directory.git
cd employee-directory
Feature	Description
👥 Employee Cards	View all employees in a clean card layout
🔍 Search Bar	Live search employees by name or email
🧭 Filter Sidebar	Filter by first name, department, and role
📊 Sort Options	Sort employees by first name or department
➕ Add Employee	Modal form to add new employee with client-side validation

📄 Pagination	Choose how many employees to show per page (10, 25, 50, 100)

 Challenges Faced
Creating dynamic employee cards using pure JavaScript DOM manipulation

Building a responsive layout from scratch with only CSS

Implementing modular code for search, filter, and pagination logic

🛠 What I’d Improve With More Time
Add Edit functionality (prefilled form to update employee details)

Store data in LocalStorage so data persists on page reload

Add form-level inline validation with error messages below inputs

Implement unit testing for logic functions (e.g., filter, search, sort)

Integrate with Freemarker templates and possibly backend APIs
